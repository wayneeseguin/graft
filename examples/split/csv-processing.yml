  # Handle empty fields
  empty_aware: (( split "," csv_advanced.with_empty ))
  # Expected: ["Alice", "", "London"]
  
  # Simple split on comma (doesn't handle quoted fields properly)
  # Note: Full CSV parsing with quoted fields requires more complex logic

  # Result will incorrectly split the quoted comma
  
  # The quoted_split field referenced in all-examples.yml was missing
