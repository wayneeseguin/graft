# Extract keys from maps
extracted:
  # Get all environment names (sorted)
  environment_list: (( keys environments ))
  # Result: ["development", "production", "staging"]
  
  # Get all service names
  service_list: (( keys services ))
  # Result: ["notification-service", "order-service", "payment-service", "user-service"]
  
  # Get all feature flags
  feature_flags: (( keys features ))
  # Result: ["analytics", "beta_api", "debug_mode", "new_ui", "social_login"]

# Using keys for summary information
