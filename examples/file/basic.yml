# Basic file operator examples
# Run setup.sh first to create the sample files!

application:
  # Read script files
  startup_script: (( file "scripts/startup.sh" ))
  health_check_script: (( file "scripts/healthcheck.sh" ))
  
  # Read certificate
  tls:
    certificate: (( file "certificates/server.crt" ))
    # In real usage, you might also have:
    # private_key: (( file "certificates/server.key" ))
  
  # Read configuration file
  database_config: (( file "configs/dev/database.conf" ))

# File operator returns the content as a string
# Perfect for embedding scripts in ConfigMaps, for example:
kubernetes:
  configmap:
    name: app-scripts
    data:
      startup.sh: (( file "scripts/startup.sh" ))
      healthcheck.sh: (( file "scripts/healthcheck.sh" ))

# You can also use it for documentation
docs:
  readme: (( file "README.md" ))
  
# Or for including JSON/YAML as raw strings (not parsed)
raw_configs:
  features_json: (( file "configs/features.json" ))
  # Note: This is the raw JSON string. To parse it, use (( load )) instead
